In this repository, you can find the assets of the new logos recently [accepted]((https://navexplorer.com/dao/consultation/e8bc48865162dc2f4fbac52b7d71835730aad5d43bbc8c3f84fc3576f27ea7e2)) by Navcoin's community through their on-chain governance (DAO) system.

The assets for NAV and xNAV are intended to be viewed as logos for each of the currencies that they represent. In addition to this, the logo for NAV will also be used as the official logo of the Navcoin project. The logo for NAV is simply the letter N with a strikethrough enabling one to read the letters N, A and V. For xNAV, the strikethrough has been removed, causing a hole on both sides of the N to symbolise breaking the link between the sender and the receiver of a transaction.
