# Proposed assets for NavCoin (by anquii) 
In this repository, you'll find proposed assets for new logos to be used as part of the NavCoin project. The proposed assets for *nav* and *xnav* are intended to be viewed as logos for each of the currencies that they represent. In addition to this, the proposed logo for *nav* is also intended as the official logo for the NavCoin project as a whole. The *nav* logo is simply the letter N with a strikethrough, enabling one to read the letters N, A and V. For *xnav*, the strikethrough has been removed, causing a hole on both sides of the N, to symbolise breaking the link between the sender and the receiver of a transaction.
